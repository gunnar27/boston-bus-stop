Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description of the project: This project displays a map of Boston using Mapbox. The project also pulls data from the Boston MTA live API to place markers on bus stops and displays a pop up with the assocated latitude and longitude positions.  

How to Run: You will need to create your own Mapbox key and then download all files to your computer to run!

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, I would like to add further functionality to show subway lines!
